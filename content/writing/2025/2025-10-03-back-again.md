So my online presence has been pretty quiet for the past 6 years. My last post, a career retrospective, was in 2019, and while I attempted some social posts here and there, it seemed far wiser to just stay offline altogether. 

I had a lot going on since then:

- an intense (confidential) corporate project
- an even more intense hustle to finish _[Information Design Unbound](https://infodesignunbound.com/)_
- burnout after finishing and launching the book
- moving from the New York area to the Boston area

There’s also the standard issue stuff: COVID lockdown, family matters, health issues, the state of the world, and so on. Only now have I had a chance to catch my breath and reflect on what I do and don't want to be doing online.

### Why come back

There are many excellent reasons _not_ to participate in any social context online. Poor content quality itself is a big problem, but what's worse is how easily the dynamics of creating and consuming content can alter one's thoughts and behavior. I learned a few hard lessons in the late 2000's and 2010's after slipping into some bad habits. First as a blogger, I sought connection, which turned to a craving for recognition, so I'd obsess over almost every post and fret when nobody commented. Later as a Twitter user, I got caught in the vicious cycle of devouring content, foolishly engaging with hot takes that pressed all the right buttons, and generating my own content stream that I had hoped others would devour and engage with... 

Oddly enough, it took another unhealthy situation to break the cycle and give me perspective. Back in 2021, already absurdly late submitting the final manuscript for _Information Design Unbound_ to the publisher, I decided that the only way to get it done was to drop everything else — including social media — and commit my every waking hour to writing, design, and illustration. Workaholism, basically.

It seemed that going cold turkey did the trick. The urge to check Twitter and post random nonsense gradually subsided, and my heart rate returned more or less to normal. The fear of missing out (FOMO) that kept me coming back was like a curse that only now had been lifted. Don't get me wrong, it was still a stressful period until the final files were out the door, but I started to see how careless I was with my attention when I was stuck on the social media hamster wheel. 

While I'm done with Twitter/X (and leaving my profile inactive until I feel like navigating the account deletion process), I'm still trying to figure out what being online means for me. The blog format is where I can share what matters to me without the forced brevity or performativeness of social media, so here we are.

Right now, I think there are two good reasons to return... in a more controlled and intentional way. 

First, I want to own my presence online and keep it up-to-date. I want to send out a beacon that yes, I’m still a Real Person&trade;, still around, and speaking for myself, not as an embarrassingly outdated search result. 

Second, I still believe in the power of this crazy planetary mesh of wires, boxes, electrons, and code to amplify knowledge and to bring people together who'd probably never cross paths in real life. My life is richer and my mind stretched thanks to the ideas and people I found (or who found me) here. Sharing pieces of one's inner and outer life, however remarkable or mundane, can lead to interesting and unexpected places, and I’m (back) here for it. But maybe a little wiser this time.

### What I’ll be writing about

I’m still planning to wrestle with more or less the same topics that got me posting online in the first place — how we make sense of the world by way of information design, visual thinking, and self-reflection. These days, I find myself immersed in systems thinking-related topics and the human challenges and limitations of engaging with massive complex problems. I’m especially interested in the tension between what helps and what hinders progress, from individual to society. In that regard, I want to look more closely at how we can enable understanding at micro, meso, and macro scales, how we can imagine possibilities for near and distant futures, and how we can make things materially better right now.

I've carried forward my back catalog of writing. Most of it is dated, cringey, and old links are broken, but maybe someone finds it interesting.

### What’s next

Looking ahead, I can’t say how often I’ll be posting here. I have a list of ideas for posts that will surely change. There won't be comments or e-mail updates, but I'd encourage readers to follow my [RSS feed](/atom.xml) and send [e-mail](mailto:mbabwa@proton.me) to start a conversation.
