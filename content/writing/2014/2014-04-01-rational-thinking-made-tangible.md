Over the years, I’ve come to understand that information design work is as much a process of reasoning and investigation as it is an activity of pure design decision-making and production. In the earliest stage of my career, I thought information design was only about making graphics that put facts and figures in a clear, understandable format. I assumed that “clear” and “understandable” meant employing graphic techniques like bold color coding, ample white space, good typography, and descriptive illustration. My design education introduced me to the formal principles and standard guidelines for doing design work, like color theory and grid systems, along with the time-honored maxims like “less is more” and “if you can’t make it bigger, make it red.” I believed I had all the ingredients and the tools to do proper information design work, with a generous dose of ego thrown in.

But the more I actually did the work and the more exposure I had to different challenges, the more gaps I uncovered in my own “expertise.” If something made sense or triggered an “aha!”, the graphic designer in me attributed the success primarily to design as I understood it — the skillful arrangement of elements on a page — and little else. What I didn’t fully acknowledge was the “why” behind information design — why does _that_ particular arrangement of elements work. And what do “clear” and “understandable” really mean?

### What makes information design work?

The answer to that question stems from a widely-circulated quote attributed to [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com), from his book _Visual Explanations_:

_Good information design is clear thinking made visible._[^1]

[^1]: The full quote is "Good information design is clear thinking made visible, while bad design is stupidity in action." After briefly Googling the quote for other instances of its use, I came across what could be its inspiration, by [Bill Wheeler](http://thinkexist.com/quotation/good_writing_is_clear_thinking_made_visible/252639.html): “Good writing is clear thinking made visible.” It isn't surprising that both writing and information design can be described in the same way.

What immediately strikes me about this definition is the order of ideas: **clear thinking precedes visualization**. It’s a simple point, but a critical one when discussing foundational aspects of information design. The ability to reason and apply rigorous logic to understanding-related challenges is what enables the effective design of information, in any form. In practice, I think "clear thinking made visible" could broadly refer to a continuum of activities:

- applying a knowledge of principles and rules behind systems to making sense of situations
- creating and using frameworks for organizing content (thoughts, ideas, data, text, etc)
- designing interfaces for those frameworks using a variety of methods, tools, and techniques (To clarify, I'm using the word "interface" loosely to refer to visual, aural, spatial, tactile, and maybe even gustatory and olfactory means of accessing and interacting with information, not just technology-based interfaces.)

There's a lot to unpack in those three bullets, perhaps in future posts. For now, I'm mainly interested in reframing information design to account for the bigger, invisible picture that happens in the "pre-visual" or "pre-artifact" stages. What I hope to see, sooner rather than later, is a shift away from the narrow graphic design-centric perspective that has hindered understanding and growth of the field and towards a cognition-centric perspective that embraces the full scope and potential of what information design is and does below the surface.

With that in mind, I propose a revision of Tufte's quote to something like this:

_Effective information design is rational thinking made tangible._

There are three key words here:

_**Effective**:_ Given the ever-expanding range of stuff passing as information design these days, it would seem necessary to distinguish works as effective or ineffective at enabling understanding, rather than simply "good," which has its own subjective meaning. The word "effective" may also promote a greater focus on how information design functions holistically, rather than just how it looks or how it works alone.

**_Rational_**: Saying "rational" instead of "clear" thinking helps put a finer point on the type of thinking involved in information design — thinking that subscribes to reason; "clarity" alone may only suggest that thoughts are distinct and well-defined, complete statements, but they may lack any basis in logic.

**_Tangible_**: Information design can take many forms once it has passed through the conceptual, "figuring out" stages. The word "tangible" need not only refer to objects or artifacts but to those things that can be experienced directly.

Information design has a long way to go before it will break free from conventional notions of what it is and can — or can't — be. Greater awareness of the upstream information design process is necessary, as are required studies in cognitive science and logic. Understanding the brain and how it works, from the theoretical to the practical levels, should be the next wave in information design education and practice, not more overemphasis on filling our design toolkit and producing dazzling outputs.
